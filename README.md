# GolfStatApp

This project was my Capstone project from when i was at devCodeCamp. This project was a 10 day sprint
project that I feel really captured what I learned while i was at devCodeCamp. The overview of the 
project was a simple web application that you can input your rounds of golf and have that information 
display on your profile and have a graph that gives some visual representation of all of your rounds you
input. The technologies I used for this project was the MERN stack so mongoDB, React, Node, Express with 
chart js to handle the and made my own API to handle the premade courses along with React Router and Bootstrap.
You could have friends on the app and see what their recent scores were and go to their profile page see all 
of their information. I had alot of fun with this project learning some new things and being able to show off
what I had already learned.
